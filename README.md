## Overview

DNN-IP-demo provides a practical introduction to applying deep neural networks to a variety of image processing problems, such as image classification, segmentation, and enhancement. The repository is structured to help researchers, students, and enthusiasts get started with deep learning in computer vision.

## Features

- Ready-to-use training and evaluation scripts
- Pre-trained model weights for quick experimentation
- Modular code structure for easy customization
- Example datasets and data loaders
- Support for common image processing tasks

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chealseainfo1/DNN-IP-demo.git
   cd DNN-IP-demo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (Python 3.7+ is recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for isolated development.

## Usage

Run training or evaluation scripts as follows:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/example_config.yaml
python evaluate.py --weights checkpoints/model_best.pth --data data/test_images/
```

Refer to the [Examples](#examples) section for more detailed command-line usage.

## Examples

- **Train a model from scratch:**
  ```bash
  python train.py --config configs/custom_config.yaml
  ```

- **Evaluate on a test dataset:**
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py --weights checkpoints/model_best.pth --data data/test_images/
  ```

- **Customize a model:**
  Modify the architecture in `models/` or change hyperparameters in the config files under `configs/`.
